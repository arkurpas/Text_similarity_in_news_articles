# Project

As textual data becomes increasingly prevalent in today's digital world, natural language processing (NLP) tools and techniques play a crucial role in extracting meaning, content classification, and text analysis. One important application of NLP is the computation of similarity between different pieces of text. This matter is of significant importance in various domains, such as information retrieval, recommendations, sentiment analysis, document classification, and more.

In this project, I will focus on harnessing NLP to calculate text similarity and show some methods that can be applied for this purpose.
